## Python data processing

There is some scope of operations in data processing which is good to keep in mind and be able to use any time. 
It may reasonably speed up problem solving during coding process.
In this script we may find operations over data structures in Python. 
For each data structure there are 6 sections of general operation types: 

1. Insertion
2. Deletion
3. Merging
4. Searching
5. Traversal
6. Sorting

In the script there are also chapters for control structures, basics of OOP, and solutions of some common excercises.
